# weight_lifting_calculator

Figure out which plates to use on the barbell for the target weight, given my current collection.

# Installation

Run: 

`pipenv install`

# Usage

To Do.

## Register Weights

Hard-coded at the moment.

## Commmands to Run

`workout_calculator(<desired weight, in lbs>)`

# Future Work

Jot down ideas for this project in the future.

## Refactor

Create a `main.py` file and refactor the code into a more package-like format.

### The Plan

Create source folder for logic.
Create separate file for holding weight list, as YAML or something like that.
Make more like an interactive tool, where you type a command and it returns to you the weights to use. 

## Add tests

Probably use pytest.

## Textual TUI

Use this project as an excuse to test out [Textual](https://pypi.org/project/textual/).
